# Ephesians: A reflective note to the epistle to the Ephesians

A personal reflection on Paul's letter to the Ephesians—God’s power, the church as His temple, and living out our calling in love and unity.

> **info**: This is my personal notes while studying Ephesians and references while attending Rooted: Discovering Ephesians on our local church.

# Introduction

## Studying the Epistles

- The Epistles are not theological treatises but letters written in response to specific circumstances. Therefore to understand an epistle, we must first try to recreate the specific historical setting.

- The following three steps will help us recreate the specific historical setting of an epistle.
- - Read the book several times through and look for information that sheds light on the audience, author and occasion.
- Bombard the book with questions.
- Compare and enlarge your findings by consulting available reference materials.

- After recreating the historical setting, look for the principles embedded in the setting.
- Determine what circumstances in the text are the same as our contemporary setting. If the specific circumstances are similar, God's word to us is the same as God's word was to them.
- Determine what circumstances in the text are different from our contemporary setting. Ask yourself what biblical principles are revealed in these circumstances.

### ACTIVITY:

#### Read Paul's letter to Philemon and answer the following questions:

- What were Paul's circumstances?
- How did Paul feel about Philemon?
- What was Paul's relationship to Philemon and how does that affect the message we are supposed to get from the epistle?
- Who was Onesimus?
- What did Onesimus do to Philemon?
- What was Paul's relationship to Onesimus?
- What did Paul request of Philemon?

#### What is one important principle you can see from this letter, and how does it apply to your life?

### AUTHORSHIP

Ephesians was written during Paul's first imprisonment at Rome.

- The epistles claims to have been written by Paul, not only in its opening (1:1) but also in the body of the letter (3:1)
- There are also many personal notes that show relationships with the Ephesian church. (1:15-16; 3:1; 4:1; 6:19-21).
- It was widely circulated from early days, and its authenticity does not seem to have been doubted until recently.
- Its structure, language, and themes follow the Pauline format in his other epistles.
- Ephesians develops Colossians, which Paul wrote first. Paul may have written Colossians with a specific situation in mind and then written Ephesians with broader purpose.

It was probably written as a circular letter sent first to the capital city of Ephesus and then distributed to the churches of Asia Minor.

### PROVENANCE:

This letter seems to have been written from the same place as Colossians.
Paul wrote this letter from prison (Col. 4:3, 10, 18), possibly from Ephesus, Caesarea, or Rome. The evidence favors Rome.

Ephesians, Colossians, and Philemon were probably written at the same time and from the same place, but Philippians (also written from prison) may have been written at a different time and place because it seems to have been written on a different occasion.

### DATE:

The letter speaks of Paul as in prison (3:1; 4:1). This is usually taken to refer to his first imprisonment in Rome toward the end of his life, which would mean a date in the early 60s.

### CHARACTERISTICS:

Ephesians is remarkably similar to Colossians, both epistles dealing mainly with the church as the body of Christ. However, in Ephesians Paul stressed the church as the body of Christ, and in Colossians he emphasized Christ as the Head of that body.

### AUDIENCE:

Although we might assume that this book was simply written to the church in Ephesus, there are two caveats we must consider:

- The phrase "in Ephesus" is absent from 1:1 in some of the best manuscripts. (On the other hand, the phrase is included in nearly all manuscripts and by all the ancient versions; even the manuscripts that lack the phrase have "To the Ephesians" in the title.)
- The calm and impersonal tone of the letter does not seem to befit Paul's relationship with the church at Ephesus. Paul had evangelized the Ephesians, spent a long time with them (Acts 19:8, 10; 20:31), and considered them his dear friends (Acts 20:17-38). Yet parts of this letter seem to indicate that the writer may not have personally interacted with the readers (e.g., 1:15; 3:2, 4:21).

These factors suggest another option for Ephesians: that Paul intended it to be a circular letter--that is, a letter intended to circulate among a general audience.

We do not, therefore, know with certainty that the letter was originally intended only for the church at Ephesus. The evidence of the great majority of the manuscripts and the improbabilities of other theories may compel us to take that view. If, on the other hand, we place great significance on the absence of Paul's characteristic warmth and of references to concrete situations, we are more likely to think of Ephesians as some form of a circular letter.

### BACKGROUND:

Ephesus was a huge city. It was the fourth largest city in the Roman empire. It was also the center for the worship of Diana or Artemis. Its temple was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.

This temple drew thousands to the city, and its priesthood used the wealth to become bankers of the East making vast loans to individuals and even nations.

Ephesus was a wealthy port city in the Roman province of Asia. It was a center of learning and was positioned near several key land routes in western Asia Minor.

Ephesus was a center of the occult, and those who practiced it used sorcery to manipulate hostile spiritual powers to their advantage.

This helps explain Paul's emphasis on the power of God over all heavenly authorities and on Christ's triumphant ascension as head over the church and over all things in this age and the next.

Paul describes the Church as God's Temple.

God the Father is the architect, Jesus is the builder, and the Holy Spirit is the divine presence that dwells in it.

The Temple is not constructed of stone, but of living people in reconciled relationships.

The treasury is stocked with spiritual blessings in heavenly places.

God's church is no heap of cold marble, but rather a vital, loving family, enriched and sustained by caring relationships. God's temple is not an ancient edifice but a growing fellowship, which keeps on building itself up in love.
The letter emphasizes that the church is not at the mercy of hostile spiritual forces.

### PURPOSE:

Most of Paul's letters were written for a specific purpose on a specific occasion, but the occasion for Ephesians is unknown. Unlike Colossians, there is no specific false teaching against which Ephesians is aimed. Apparently, Paul thought his readers needed to be exhorted to pursue unity and a distinctively Christian ethic.

Paul's frequent references to the church as a mystery, previously unknown but now revealed, identify the apostle's main purpose in writing as having been the exposition of the mystery of the church (1:9; 3:3-4; 5:32; 6:19). Particularly he wanted to facilitate unity among Jews and Gentiles in the church.

### STRUCTURE:

The structure of the letter follows a pattern that is normal with Paul--doctrine then application.

The first three chapters deal with the theological foundation (indicatives).

The last three deal with the practical implications of those theological foundations (imperatives). - Indicatives as enabling reasons.

Paul was not content to discuss doctrine without it leading to practical application. He was not content to give moral imperatives without first grounding them in what God has done in Christ.

The verse linking doctrine to application is this . . .

Ephesians 4:1
I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called.

### THEMES:

#### THE EXALTED CHRIST

> Ephesians 1:19-23
> 19 and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of his great might 20 that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, 21 far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come. 22 And he put all things under his feet and gave him as head over all things to the church, 23 which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.

> Ephesians 2:13
> 13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.

> Ephesians 1:3
> 3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places,

> Ephesians 3:12
> 12 in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him.

#### GOD'S ETERNAL PLAN

> Ephesians 1:4
> 4 even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love

> Ephesians 1:9-10
> 9 making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his purpose, which he set forth in Christ 10 as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth.

> Ephesians 3:10-11
> 10 so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. 11 This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord,

#### GRACE OF GOD

> Ephesians 2:4-8
> 4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, 5 even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved— 6 and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, 7 so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. 8 For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God,

#### MYSTERY

> Ephesians 1:9
> 9 making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his purpose, which he set forth in Christ

> Ephesians 1:18
> 18 having the eyes of your hearts enlightened, that you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints,

> Ephesians 4:18
> 18 They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to their hardness of heart.

> Ephesians 6:19
> 19 and also for me, that words may be given to me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel,

> Ephesians 5:8-10
> 8 for at one time you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light 9 (for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true), 10 and try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord.

#### GLORIOUS CHURCH

> Ephesians 2:19-22
> 19 So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, 20 built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, 21 in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord. 22 In him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.

Ephesians tells us more about the church than any other letter:

- The Fullness of Christ (Eph 1:22-23)
- God's Workmanship (Eph 2:10)
- One New Man (Eph 2:15)
- Household of God (Eph 2:19)
- The Temple of God (Eph 2:21)
- Expression of God's Manifold Wisdom (Eph 3:10)
- The Stature of Christ (Eph 4:12-13)
- The Bride of Christ (Eph 5:22-23)
- The Object of Christ's love (Eph 5:25)
- Member of Christ's Body (Eph 5:30)
- God's Warrior (Eph 6:11-18)

#### TIMELESS THEOLOGICAL TRUTHS:

#### God's sovereignty in Salvation.

- God chose believers before the creation of the world. They did not earn their salvation; God planned it in accordance with his pleasure and supreme will (Eph 1:3-11).

#### Christ's saving work.

- Blessings in Christ include sonship, redemption, and sealing with the Holy Spirit (Eph 1:5, 7, 13). He reconciles the universe (Eph 1:10) and Jews and Gentiles in the church (Eph 2:11-22; 3:10).

#### Christian growth in knowledge.

- What we could never work out for ourselves God has now made known. This is conveyed by the rich allusions to "mystery (Eph 1:9; 3:3-11; 5:32; 6:19) and the concept of enlightenment (1:18; 4:18; 5:8-10, 17).

#### Union with Christ

- The recurrence of the phrase "in Christ" and equivalent expressions emphasizes that all these blessings come with our union with our Savior.

#### Love

- The word agape ("love") occurs more often in Ephesians than in any other NT book except 1 Corinthians and 1 John. (See especially Eph 3:17-19.)

#### Church

- As the body and temple of Christ, the church occupies an important place in God's master plan (Eph 2:20-22). It is characterized by unity in diversity (Eph 2:11-3:6; 4:3-6, 11-13).

#### Transformed lives (Eph 4:1-6:18)

- Christians "must no longer live as the Gentiles do" (Eph 4:17). The contrast is like darkness and light (Eph 5:8). This has vital entailments for wives and husbands, children and parents, slaves and masters (Eph 5:22-6:9). Gospel-centered living by wearing God's armor is the only hope for Christians in the struggle against "spiritual forces of evil" (Eph 6:10-18).

#### Spiritual Power and Spiritual Warfare

- The existence of supernatural beings who seek to exercise spiritual authority is taught in several Pauline letters. Paul stresses the significance both of the exaltation of Christ above all existing spiritual forces and of the continuing battle in which Christians are engaged against them.
